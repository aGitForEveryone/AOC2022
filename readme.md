# Advent of code 2022
This repository contains my solution attempts for advent of code 2022. Advent of
code is a yearly programming puzzle event happening in December. Every day, 
starting from December 1st and ending on December 25th, a puzzle is released.
It is free to participate, so if you want to try out yourself, 
visit [adventofcode.com](adventofcode.com), login with your favorite platform, 
and get started. 

# Repository structure
The code for each puzzle is contained within it's own directory named `dayXX`.
The repository contains a setup script for quickly setting up the code for each
puzzle. You can call the code via the command line:
```bash
python setup_new_day.py [day]
```
replace `[day]` by the day number for which the code should be initialized. 
Leave the day value empty to generate code for today's puzzle.
